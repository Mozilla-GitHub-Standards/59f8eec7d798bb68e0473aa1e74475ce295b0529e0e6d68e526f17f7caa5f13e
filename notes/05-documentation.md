# Documentation

Software programmers and developers like to write code but writing "documentation" for their code is considered a chore. This is easily discernable on the most popular code hosting service - Github, which has tons of open source software repo's but only a fraction of these are well-documented. The downside? Thanks to the lack of proper documentation within their codebase, many Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) projects struggle to find new contributors. 

Lets say, a user wants to fix a bug but writing the code patch and testing it isnt enough. Inaddition to fixing the bug, she has to wade through your complex codebase to figure out what each function, class or module does. That seems quite unreasonable given that volunteers are after-all unpaid contributors who are trying to help fix things.
