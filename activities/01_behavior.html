      <h2>The most important trait of any piece of code, is that it gets the job done. In this activity, learners will write & share some code, and try to determine if it's doing what it's supposed to.</h2>

          <h2>Steps for the Activity</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Have a look at the project description <a href='http://media1.giphy.com/media/hMtf0t0g3UP9m/giphy.gif'>here</a> - this is an analysis program that consists of four Python functions, each of which is responsible for a single step: data generation, data cleaning, data analysis, and presentation. Randomly choose one of the functions described, and write it yourself. Don't tell anyone which one you chose!
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, find a partner and exchange the functions you wrote above - but don't explain them at all! For your partner's function, try and determine the following things:
              </p>
              <div class="well example">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>What's it supposed to do?</strong> Which of the four functions in the project description is this? How can you tell? What could be done to make it clearer what this function was supposed to do?</li>
                  <li><strong>What's it actually do?</strong> Try making up some dummy inputs and running the function. Does it do what you'd expect? Are there inputs you can provide that make it do something different or unexpected?
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Does it actually do what it's supposed to do?</strong> Does the behavior of the function completely satisfy the expectations laid out in the project description? Can you spot times when it will fail?</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Share your findings with your partner. Did they understand what you were trying to build? Could it be demonstrated that it did what it was supposed to? Discuss.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Finally, share any surprises or ideas with everyone else. Make a list together of ways to clearly explain what a new piece of code is supposed to do, and strategies you thought of for ensuring that it actually does those things.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

            After this activity, you can start your own code quality checklist! When you're thinking about a piece of code, start by asking yourself:
            <ul>
              <li>Is it clear what the code is supposed to do?</li>
              <li>Does the code actually satisfy its intended purpose?</li>
            </ul>
