Coding Science
==============

The role of code in science is quickly expanding in almost all scientific disciplines. But as we welcome computation into our professional fold and begin to understand coding as part of the technical bedrock of modern research, the need arises to understand not just the procedure of *writing code*, but the practice of *building software* - software that not only works today, but that lasts, evolves, and empowers over many years.

Coding Science is a collecion of notes and lessons from the Mozilla Science Lab on these practices, as seen through the lens of science as it is done today. In it, we'll cover the code review, software design, and project planning that keeps software projects healthy, makes them simple to build and maintain, and even a joy to use.
